## JS 1.1 JavaScript / ECMAScript
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. It's the standard scripting language for the web, and it's supported by all modern browsers. ECMAScript is the specification that JavaScript follows, and it gets updated with new features and improvements. For example, ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced features like arrow functions and classes.

## JS 1.2 JavaScript-ramverk och -bibliotek
JavaScript frameworks and libraries help developers build web applications more easily. Frameworks like React and Vue provide structures and tools for building complex apps. Libraries like jQuery offer pre-written code to handle common tasks. Using these can save time and make code more manageable.

## JS 1.3 Promises
Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future. Promises help manage tasks like fetching data from a server without blocking the main thread. They have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.

## JS 1.4 OOP i JavaScript
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript involves using objects and classes to structure your code. JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance, but ES6 introduced class syntax to make OOP more familiar and straightforward. OOP helps in organizing code, reusing components, and creating more complex applications.

## JS 1.5 DOM-manipulation
DOM manipulation is about changing the structure and content of a web page using JavaScript. The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the page as a tree of nodes. With JavaScript, you can add, remove, or update elements and their attributes, which allows for dynamic changes on the page.

## JS 1.6 HTTP-requests
HTTP requests are used to communicate with servers. JavaScript can send requests to servers to fetch or send data using methods like `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`. This is crucial for operations like loading data from APIs or submitting forms without reloading the page.

## JS 1.7 Lexical scope
Lexical scope refers to how variable names are resolved in nested functions. In JavaScript, functions have access to variables from their own scope and the outer scopes. This means that inner functions can access variables from outer functions, which helps in creating closures and maintaining state.

## JS 1.8 Event handling
Event handling is how JavaScript responds to user interactions like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements. You can attach event listeners to elements to execute code when specific events occur. This makes web pages interactive and responsive to user actions.

## JS 1.9 Prototype inheritance
Prototype inheritance is how JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, and objects can share features through this prototype chain. This allows for code reuse and the creation of complex object hierarchies.

## JS 1.10 Higher-order functions
Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. They are useful for creating more abstract and reusable code. Examples include `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`, which operate on arrays and allow for functional programming techniques.

## JS 1.11 Single-thread programming
JavaScript runs on a single thread, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. This single-threaded nature is managed by the event loop, which allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks efficiently without blocking the main thread. Understanding this is key to writing performant and responsive code.

## JS 1.12 OAuth fr√•n frontend
OAuth is a protocol for authorization, often used to grant third-party applications limited access to user resources. In frontend development, OAuth helps manage user authentication by redirecting users to a service provider's login page and handling tokens securely.

## JS 1.13 Websockets
Websockets provide a way to open a continuous connection between the client and server. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, Websockets allow for real-time communication by sending data back and forth over a single, long-lived connection. This is useful for applications like chat apps or live updates.
