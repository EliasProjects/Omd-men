## BE 1.1 PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language that's used to build websites and web applications. It runs on the server and generates HTML that’s sent to the client. PHP is popular because it's easy to use and integrates well with databases, like MySQL, to handle data.

## BE 1.2 OOP i PHP
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. In PHP, OOP helps you organize code into classes and objects. This way, you can create reusable pieces of code and manage complex applications more easily. For example, you can have a `User` class to manage user-related data and actions.

## BE 1.3 Säkerhet i PHP
Security in PHP involves protecting your web application from threats like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This includes practices like validating user input, using prepared statements for database queries, and properly escaping data before displaying it.

## BE 1.4 MVC
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It’s a design pattern used to separate the data (Model), the user interface (View), and the application logic (Controller). This helps in organizing code and making it easier to manage and scale. For instance, in an MVC framework, the Model handles data, the View presents it, and the Controller processes user input.

## BE 1.5 Wordpress
WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) built with PHP. It allows you to create and manage websites easily. You can use themes and plugins to customize the look and functionality of your site without needing to code everything from scratch.

## BE 1.6 Heirarkiska databaser
Hierarchical databases store data in a tree-like structure, with parent and child records. This means each parent record can have multiple child records, but each child record has only one parent. An example of a hierarchical database is an old-school IBM Information Management System (IMS).

## BE 1.7 Relationsdatabaser, SQL och ER-modellering
Relational databases use tables to store data, and SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and query that data. ER (Entity-Relationship) modeling is a way to design your database by defining the entities (like tables) and the relationships between them. This helps in structuring data efficiently.

## BE 1.8 OAuth i backend
OAuth is a protocol for authorization. It allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their passwords. In the backend, you implement OAuth to handle secure access to APIs or user data. For example, OAuth is used when you log into a website using your Google or Facebook account.

## BE 1.9 HTTP-protokollet
The HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol is used for communication between a client (like a web browser) and a server. It defines how requests and responses are formatted. For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, an HTTP request is sent to the server, and the server responds with the requested web page.

## BE 1.10 cURL
cURL is a tool used for making network requests from the command line or from within code. It supports various protocols like HTTP, FTP, and more. In PHP, you can use cURL to fetch data from APIs or send data to a server.

## BE 1.11 REST
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources. RESTful APIs are commonly used to allow different applications to communicate over the web.

## BE 1.12 XML och andra dataformat
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a format for structuring data in a way that’s both human-readable and machine-readable. Other data formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is more lightweight and often used in web APIs. Understanding these formats helps in exchanging data between systems.

## BE 1.13 Webbservrar
Web servers are software that handles HTTP requests and serves web pages to clients. They manage the communication between the client and the server and can handle tasks like serving static files or running server-side scripts. Examples of web servers include Apache and Nginx.
