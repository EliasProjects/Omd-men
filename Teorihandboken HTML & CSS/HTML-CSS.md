## HC 1.1 HTML & CSS
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It structures the content on a webpage, like text, images, and links. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style that content. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of the webpage. Together, HTML and CSS make web pages look good and work well.

## HC 1.2 Responsiv design
Responsive design ensures that a webpage looks good on all devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. This is done using CSS media queries to apply different styles depending on the screen size. For example, you might use a single-column layout for mobile devices and a multi-column layout for desktops.

## HC 1.3 Tillgänglighet inom webb
Web accessibility means designing websites so that they can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. This involves using semantic HTML for better screen reader support, providing text alternatives for images, and ensuring that the website can be navigated using a keyboard. Accessibility helps make the web inclusive for all users.

## HC 1.4 Aktuella webbstandarder (gällande och kommande standarder)
Web standards are guidelines and rules for creating web content. They ensure that websites are compatible with different browsers and devices. Current standards include HTML5 and CSS3, which offer new features and improvements. Keeping up with these standards ensures your site works well and is future-proof.

## HC 1.5 CSS Pre-processorer (ex SASS/LESS)
CSS pre-processors like SASS and LESS extend the functionality of CSS. They allow you to use variables, nested rules, and functions in your stylesheets, making your CSS more organized and easier to maintain. For example, SASS allows you to create reusable style components and use advanced features like mixins and inheritance.

## HC 1.6 Optimering och validering av HTML & CSS
Optimizing and validating HTML and CSS involves making sure your code is clean, efficient, and error-free. Validation tools check if your code follows web standards and can help catch mistakes. Optimization involves techniques to improve performance, like minifying CSS files to reduce load times.
