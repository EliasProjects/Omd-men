## AJ 1.1 Node.js
Node.js is a tool that lets you run JavaScript on your server, not just in the browser. It uses something called the V8 engine (the same one in Chrome) to execute JavaScript code. This means you can build things like web servers or APIs using JavaScript. It’s great for handling lots of requests at once because it's built to be fast and efficient.

## AJ 1.2 Express
Express is a web framework for Node.js. It helps you set up your server and handle different routes in a clean and simple way. With Express, you can easily manage things like sending responses to the client, handling form submissions, and setting up REST APIs. It makes building web applications faster and more organized.

## AJ 1.3 Progressive Web Apps
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are websites that look and feel like mobile apps. They work well on any device and can even be used offline. PWAs use modern web technologies like service workers to cache content, so the app loads quickly and can work without an internet connection. They also have features like push notifications and home screen icons.

## AJ 1.4 Typningssystem för Javascript (ex TypeScript, Flow)
Typing systems like TypeScript and Flow add types to JavaScript. This means you can define what kind of data your functions should use (like numbers or strings) and catch errors before running your code. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it adds types while still allowing you to use regular JavaScript. Flow is another tool that helps with typing in JavaScript, but it’s less popular than TypeScript.

## AJ 1.5 Funktionell programmering i JavaScript
Functional programming is a way of writing code where you focus on using functions and avoid changing data or using state. In JavaScript, this means using things like pure functions (functions that don’t change anything outside themselves) and higher-order functions (functions that can take other functions as arguments). It can make your code easier to understand and test.

## AJ 1.6 Avancerad funktionalitet i ES.next
ES.next refers to future versions of JavaScript that include new features. For example, newer versions of JavaScript (like ES6 and beyond) have added features like arrow functions, async/await, and classes. These features make writing JavaScript easier and more powerful, helping with things like handling asynchronous operations or creating complex applications.

## AJ 1.7 JavaScript i integrerade system
JavaScript in integrated systems means using JavaScript in environments other than the web browser. For example, you might use JavaScript in Internet of Things (IoT) devices or embedded systems. It’s about making JavaScript work in different settings, not just on the web.

## AJ 1.8 Native bundeling av JavaScript för olika operativsystem och enheter
Native bundling is about packaging your JavaScript code so it can run as a native app on different operating systems or devices. Tools like Electron or NW.js let you use JavaScript to build desktop apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This way, you can create applications that look and feel like native apps but are built using web technologies.
