## UD 1.1 Grafik och design för webbsidor
Graphic design for websites involves creating visual elements that make a website look appealing and functional. This includes choosing colors, fonts, images, and layout styles that align with the website’s purpose and brand identity. Key aspects include:

- **Layout**: Organizing content in a way that is easy to navigate. This involves using grids and spacing to ensure a clean, balanced look.
- **Typography**: Selecting fonts that are readable and fit the website’s style. Good typography improves readability and user experience.
- **Color Scheme**: Choosing colors that complement each other and enhance the user experience. Colors should reflect the brand and be accessible to all users.

## UD 1.2 UX och användbarhet
User Experience (UX) and usability focus on how users interact with a website or application. 

- **UX Design**: Aims to create a positive experience for users by making the website easy to use and enjoyable. This includes designing intuitive navigation, clear content, and responsive layouts.
- **Usability**: Refers to how effectively users can accomplish their goals on the website. It involves ensuring that the site is easy to navigate, information is easy to find, and interactions are straightforward.

Good UX design improves user satisfaction and helps achieve business goals by making sure users can easily and efficiently use the product.

## UD 1.3 Riktlinjer för användbarhet
Usability guidelines are rules and best practices that help ensure a website is user-friendly. 

- **Consistency**: Ensuring that similar elements look and behave the same way throughout the site to avoid confusion.
- **Accessibility**: Making sure that the website can be used by people with disabilities. This includes providing alternative text for images and ensuring the site works with screen readers.
- **Feedback**: Providing users with clear feedback on their actions, like showing a confirmation message after submitting a form.

Following these guidelines helps create a website that is easier for users to interact with and navigate.

## UD 1.4 Prototyping
Prototyping is the process of creating a preliminary version of a website or application to test ideas and gather feedback. 

- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: Simple sketches or wireframes that show the basic layout and functionality. These are quick to create and useful for early-stage testing.
- **High-Fidelity Prototypes**: Detailed and interactive models that closely resemble the final product. These are used to test more specific features and design details.

Prototypes help designers and stakeholders visualize and evaluate the design before final development.

## UD 1.5 Personas och målgruppsanalys
Personas and target audience analysis are methods for understanding who will use the website and what their needs are.

- **Personas**: Fictional characters created based on research to represent different user types. Each persona has specific goals, needs, and behaviors.
- **Target Audience Analysis**: Involves researching and analyzing the actual users of the website to understand their demographics, preferences, and challenges.

These methods help design a website that meets the needs of its users and provides a better user experience.

## UD 1.6 Empiriska metoder
Empirical methods involve using real data and observations to inform design decisions. 

- **User Testing**: Involves observing real users as they interact with the website to identify issues and gather feedback.
- **Surveys and Interviews**: Collecting opinions and experiences from users to understand their needs and preferences.

Using empirical methods helps make design decisions based on actual user behavior rather than assumptions.

## UD 1.7 Grundläggande kognitionspsykologi
Basic cognitive psychology is the study of how people think, learn, and remember information. 

- **Perception**: Understanding how users perceive and interpret visual elements on a website. This includes factors like color contrast and visual hierarchy.
- **Memory**: Designing for how users remember information. This involves creating consistent and memorable navigation paths and content.

Applying principles from cognitive psychology helps design websites that align with how users naturally think and process information.
