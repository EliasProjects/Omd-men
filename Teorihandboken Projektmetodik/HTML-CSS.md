## HC 1.1 HTML & CSS
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the building blocks of web design. HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, and links. CSS is used to style that structure, such as changing colors, fonts, and layouts. Together, they make webpages look good and function well.

## HC 1.2 Responsiv design
Responsive design ensures that a website looks good on all devices, from desktops to smartphones. This is done by using flexible grids, layouts, and media queries in CSS. For example, you might use media queries to change the layout of a webpage when viewed on a smaller screen to ensure it’s easy to navigate.

## HC 1.3 Tillgänglighet inom webb
Web accessibility means making websites usable for everyone, including people with disabilities. This involves things like adding alt text to images for screen readers, ensuring good contrast between text and background, and making sure the site can be navigated with a keyboard. Accessibility ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and use your site.

## HC 1.4 Aktuella webbstandarder (gällande och kommande standarder)
Web standards are guidelines and best practices for creating websites. They help ensure that websites work consistently across different browsers and devices. Current standards include HTML5 and CSS3. Future standards are being developed to improve web features, performance, and accessibility. Staying up-to-date with these standards helps create better and more compatible websites.

## HC 1.5 CSS Pre-processorer (ex SASS/LESS)
CSS preprocessors like SASS and LESS help make writing CSS easier and more powerful. They allow you to use features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, which make your CSS more maintainable and organized. For example, you can use variables to define a color scheme and then reuse those variables throughout your stylesheets.

## HC 1.6 Optimering och validering av HTML & CSS
Optimizing and validating HTML and CSS is about making sure your code is clean and works well. Validation checks that your code follows web standards and doesn’t have errors. Optimization might include things like minifying your CSS and HTML files to make them smaller and faster to load. Clean and efficient code leads to better performance and fewer issues in browsers.
