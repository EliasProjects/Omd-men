## JS 1.1 JavaScript / ECMAScript
JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites interactive. ECMAScript is the standard specification that JavaScript follows. New versions of ECMAScript add more features and improvements to JavaScript. For example, ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) introduced features like arrow functions and classes.

## JS 1.2 JavaScript-ramverk och -bibliotek
JavaScript frameworks and libraries are tools that help you build websites more efficiently. A library, like jQuery, provides pre-written code to simplify tasks. A framework, like React or Angular, gives you a whole structure to build your app. These tools help you write less code and manage complex tasks more easily.

## JS 1.3 Promises
Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations, like fetching data from a server. A promise represents a value that might not be available yet but will be in the future. It helps you deal with operations that take time without blocking your code, using `.then()` for success and `.catch()` for errors.

## JS 1.4 OOP i JavaScript
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript involves using objects and classes to structure your code. You create classes to define objects and their behaviors, making your code more organized and reusable. For instance, you might have a `Car` class with properties like `color` and methods like `drive()`.

## JS 1.5 DOM-manipulation
DOM manipulation means changing the content and structure of a web page dynamically using JavaScript. You can use JavaScript to add, remove, or modify elements on a page. For example, you might use `document.getElementById('myElement').innerHTML = 'New content';` to update what’s shown to the user.

## JS 1.6 HTTP-requests
HTTP requests in JavaScript are used to communicate with a server. You can use `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest` to send and receive data from a server. For example, you might send a GET request to retrieve user data and then display it on your webpage.

## JS 1.7 Lexical scope
Lexical scope refers to how variables are scoped and accessible in nested functions. In JavaScript, a function’s scope is determined by where it is defined, not where it is called. This means that inner functions have access to variables in their outer functions, but not vice versa.

## JS 1.8 Event handling
Event handling in JavaScript allows you to respond to user actions like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements. You use event listeners to execute code when an event occurs. For example, you might add an event listener to a button to show an alert when it’s clicked.

## JS 1.9 Prototype inheritance
Prototype inheritance is a way that JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, and objects can access properties and methods from their prototype. This allows for creating object hierarchies and sharing functionality across objects.

## JS 1.10 Higher-order functions
Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. For example, the `map()` function is a higher-order function that takes a callback function to transform each item in an array. Higher-order functions make your code more abstract and reusable.

## JS 1.11 Single-thread programming
JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one piece of code at a time. However, it uses asynchronous features like promises and `setTimeout` to handle tasks that take time without freezing up the whole program. This allows for smooth and responsive user experiences.

## JS 1.12 OAuth från frontend
OAuth from the frontend is about allowing users to log in to your app using another service, like Google or Facebook, without sharing their password with you. You use OAuth to get an access token that lets your app access user data from the other service securely.

## JS 1.13 Websockets
Websockets provide a way to open a persistent connection between the client and server. Unlike HTTP, which is request-response based, websockets allow for real-time, two-way communication. This is useful for applications that need constant updates, like chat applications or live data feeds.
