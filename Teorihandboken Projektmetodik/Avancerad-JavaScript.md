## AJ 1.1 Node.js
Node.js is like a way to run JavaScript on the server, not just in the browser. So, instead of just making websites interactive, you can actually build the backend of a website too, like handling databases and stuff. It’s pretty cool because it lets you use JavaScript for everything.

## AJ 1.2 Express
Express is kind of like a helper for Node.js. It makes it easier to build websites and APIs. With Express, you can manage routes (like URLs) and handle requests without having to write a lot of complicated code. It’s really popular because it’s simple and works well with Node.js.

## AJ 1.3 Progressive Web Apps
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are websites that feel like apps on your phone. They can work offline, send notifications, and even be added to your home screen like a real app. The idea is to make web apps more reliable and fast, so users have a better experience.

## AJ 1.4 Typningssystem för Javascript (ex TypeScript, Flow)
Typing systems like TypeScript and Flow help you catch errors in your JavaScript code before you even run it. They add types to your variables, so if you try to do something weird, like add a number to a string, it’ll warn you. It makes coding a bit safer and easier to manage, especially in big projects.

## AJ 1.5 Funktionell programmering i JavaScript
Functional programming in JavaScript is all about writing code with functions that don’t change things outside their scope. It’s like building your code out of small, reusable pieces that are easier to test and understand. Things like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are common functional programming tools in JS.

## AJ 1.6 Avancerad funktionalitet i ES.next
ES.next is basically the newest version of JavaScript. It has a lot of cool features that make coding easier and more powerful. For example, things like async/await for handling promises or arrow functions to write shorter code. It’s all about making JavaScript more modern and efficient.

## AJ 1.7 JavaScript i integrerade system
JavaScript can also be used in embedded systems, which are like tiny computers inside devices (think smart fridges or wearables). Using JS in these systems is interesting because it means you can use the same language for web development and for controlling hardware.

## AJ 1.8 Native bundeling av JavaScript för olika operativsystem och enheter
Native bundling means taking your JavaScript code and packaging it so it can run on different devices, like phones or tablets, as if it were a native app. Tools like Electron or React Native help you do this, so you can write your code once and use it across multiple platforms.
