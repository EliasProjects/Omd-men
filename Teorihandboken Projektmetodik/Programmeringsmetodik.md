## PG 1.1 Versionshantering (Git)
Git is a tool used to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. It helps you manage different versions of your project, so you can go back to previous versions if something goes wrong. With Git, you create repositories to store your code and use commands like `commit`, `push`, and `pull` to manage and share changes.

## PG 1.2 Benchmarking
Benchmarking involves measuring the performance of your code to see how fast or efficient it is. You run tests to compare different pieces of code or algorithms to find out which one performs better. For example, you might benchmark sorting algorithms to see which one sorts data the fastest.

## PG 1.3 Testdriven utveckling
Test-driven development (TDD) is a method where you write tests for your code before you actually write the code itself. First, you write a test that defines what the code should do, then you write the code to make the test pass. This helps ensure your code works as expected and makes it easier to spot errors early.

## PG 1.4 Deploy och staging
Deployment is the process of getting your code from your development environment to a live server where users can access it. Staging is a step before deployment where you test your code in an environment that’s similar to the live server. This helps catch issues before they affect real users.

## PG 1.5 Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. When something doesn’t work as expected, you use debugging tools to trace through your code, inspect variables, and figure out what went wrong. It’s a crucial skill for resolving issues and improving code quality.

## PG 1.6 Dokumentation
Documentation involves writing explanations and guides for your code. Good documentation helps others (and yourself) understand how your code works and how to use it. This includes comments in the code, README files, and other materials that describe the functionality and usage of your project.

## PG 1.7 Struktur av kod i projekt
Structuring code in a project means organizing your code in a way that makes it easy to manage and understand. This includes breaking your code into modules or components, following naming conventions, and using clear file and folder structures. Good organization helps keep your project maintainable and scalable.

## PG 1.8 Automatisering av arbetsflöde
Automating your workflow means using tools and scripts to handle repetitive tasks automatically. This can include things like running tests, building your project, or deploying code. Automation saves time and reduces the chance of human error by making processes more efficient.

## PG 1.9 Virtualisering av utvecklingsmiljö
Virtualizing your development environment involves using virtual machines or containers to create isolated environments for your projects. This ensures that your code runs consistently regardless of the underlying system. Tools like Docker help set up and manage these environments.

## PG 1.10 Bundeling-verktyg
Bundling tools, like Webpack or Parcel, are used to combine and optimize your code and assets for production. They take your separate files (like JavaScript, CSS, and images) and bundle them into fewer files to improve performance and reduce load times on the web.

## PG 1.11 Terminalinterface
The terminal interface, or command line, is a way to interact with your computer using text commands. It’s used for tasks like navigating directories, running scripts, and managing files. Learning to use the terminal can help you perform tasks more quickly and efficiently compared to using a graphical interface.
