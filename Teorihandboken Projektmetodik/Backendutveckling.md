## BE 1.1 PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language used to create dynamic web pages. When you visit a website and see content that changes based on your actions (like a login system), PHP might be handling that behind the scenes. It’s pretty easy to pick up and is widely used in web development.

## BE 1.2 OOP i PHP
OOP, or Object-Oriented Programming, in PHP helps you organize your code using objects and classes. Instead of writing long scripts, you create classes that can hold data and methods. This makes your code more organized and reusable. For example, you could have a `User` class to manage user data and actions.

## BE 1.3 Säkerhet i PHP
Security in PHP is all about protecting your website from things like hackers. This means using techniques to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities. Simple practices include using prepared statements for database queries and validating user input.

## BE 1.4 MVC
MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a design pattern used in web development. It separates your application into three parts: 
- **Model**: Manages the data and business logic.
- **View**: Handles how the data is presented (like HTML).
- **Controller**: Manages user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
This separation makes it easier to manage and scale your web application.

## BE 1.5 Wordpress
WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that helps you build websites and blogs without needing to code everything from scratch. It has a lot of themes and plugins to customize your site, making it really user-friendly and flexible.

## BE 1.6 Heirarkiska databaser
Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent and can have multiple children. This kind of structure is good for representing data with a clear hierarchy, like an organization chart. It's not as commonly used now, but it’s a useful concept in understanding data relationships.

## BE 1.7 Relationsdatabaser, SQL och ER-modellering
Relational databases use tables to store data and relationships between them. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with these databases, like querying for specific data or updating records. ER (Entity-Relationship) modeling helps design the database structure by defining entities (like users or products) and their relationships.

## BE 1.8 OAuth i backend
OAuth is a protocol used for authorization. It allows users to give third-party applications access to their data without sharing their passwords. For example, when you log in to a website using your Google account, OAuth is often used to handle that login process securely.

## BE 1.9 HTTP-protokollet
The HTTP protocol is what web browsers use to communicate with servers. It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. HTTP is fundamental to the web, handling everything from loading web pages to sending form data.

## BE 1.10 cURL
cURL is a tool used to transfer data to or from a server using various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. In PHP, you use cURL to make requests to other servers and get data back. For instance, you might use cURL to fetch data from an external API.

## BE 1.11 REST
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It's an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. It’s widely used for web services because it’s simple and stateless.

## BE 1.12 XML och andra dataformat
XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a format for structuring data. It's used to store and transport data in a readable format. There are also other data formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) which is often preferred for APIs because it’s lighter and easier to work with in JavaScript.

## BE 1.13 Webbservrar
Web servers are what serve your website to the users. They handle requests from browsers and send back the appropriate web pages or files. Examples include Apache and Nginx. The server processes requests and ensures that the right data or content is delivered to users.
