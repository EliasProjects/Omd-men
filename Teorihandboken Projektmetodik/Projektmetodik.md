## PJ 1.1 Agila metoder (Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming)
Agile methods are approaches to project management that focus on flexibility and continuous improvement. 

- **Scrum** is a framework that organizes work into small, manageable chunks called sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks. Teams hold regular meetings (daily stand-ups) to discuss progress and adjust plans as needed.
- **Kanban** is a visual method for managing work. It uses a board with columns (like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done") to track tasks and limit work in progress. This helps teams focus on completing tasks before starting new ones.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)** emphasizes technical excellence and frequent releases of small increments of software. It involves practices like pair programming, where two developers work together on the same code, and continuous integration, where code is integrated and tested frequently.

## PJ 1.2 Icke-agila metoder
Non-agile methods are traditional approaches to project management that are more rigid and plan-driven.

- **Waterfall** is a sequential approach where each phase (like design, development, testing) must be completed before moving to the next. It's like following a strict recipe, where you have to finish each step in order.
- **V-Model** is similar to Waterfall but adds a testing phase for each development stage. It ensures that each part of the project is tested thoroughly before moving on to the next stage.

These methods work well for projects with clear, unchanging requirements but can be less flexible if changes occur during development.

## PJ 1.3 Entreprenörskap inom webbutveckling
Entrepreneurship in web development involves starting and managing a business that provides web-related services or products. This includes identifying market needs, developing a business plan, and building a team to deliver web solutions.

- **Market Research** helps you understand what potential customers need and how to offer something unique. 
- **Business Plan** outlines your goals, target audience, revenue model, and strategies for growth.
- **Web Development Skills** are crucial for creating and maintaining websites and applications that meet customer expectations.

Entrepreneurship in web development also involves staying up-to-date with technology trends and continuously adapting to changes in the market.

## PJ 1.4 Issue distribution and handling in a group
Issue distribution and handling involve managing tasks and problems in a team setting. 

- **Issue Tracking Systems** like Jira or GitHub Issues are used to log, assign, and track issues or tasks. Each issue can be assigned to different team members with specific deadlines.
- **Prioritization** is important to focus on the most critical issues first. This often involves categorizing issues as high, medium, or low priority.
- **Communication** and **Collaboration** are key to effective issue handling. Regular meetings and updates help ensure everyone is on the same page and can address issues promptly.

Proper issue distribution and handling help teams stay organized and ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.
