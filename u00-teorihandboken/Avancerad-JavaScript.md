## AJ 1.1 Node.js

**What is Node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It lets you run JavaScript on the server side, so you can build server-side applications using JavaScript. This allows for handling server tasks like interacting with databases, managing files, and processing HTTP requests.

**How is Node.js used?**

Node.js is used to build various types of network applications, such as web servers, real-time applications (like chat apps), and RESTful APIs. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it efficient at handling many simultaneous connections.

**Why use Node.js?**

Node.js is chosen for its performance and scalability. It's particularly good for applications that need to handle a lot of connections or real-time data. Its single-threaded model with asynchronous operations helps manage large numbers of connections efficiently.

## AJ 1.2 Express

**What is Express?**

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by providing a set of tools and middleware.

**How is Express used?**

Express is used to build web servers and APIs. It helps handle routing, manage HTTP requests, and integrate with various databases and other services. Express makes it easier to set up middleware to handle things like authentication, error handling, and logging.

**Why use Express?**

Express is popular because it simplifies server-side development with Node.js. It provides a straightforward API for setting up routes and handling requests, making it faster to develop web applications and APIs. Its flexibility and ease of use make it a common choice for developers.

## AJ 1.3 Progressive Web Apps

**What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)?**

Progressive Web Apps are web applications that use modern web technologies to provide an app-like experience. They can work offline, load quickly, and offer a more engaging experience similar to native apps on mobile devices.

**How are PWAs used?**

PWAs use technologies like Service Workers and Web Manifests to provide offline capabilities, push notifications, and home screen installation. They are designed to be reliable, fast, and engaging, providing a better user experience across different devices and network conditions.

**Why use PWAs?**

PWAs enhance user experience by combining the best of web and mobile apps. They are accessible via a URL and can be installed on devices, offering offline access and push notifications. PWAs improve performance and user engagement, making them a great choice for modern web applications.

## AJ 1.4 Typningssystem för Javascript (ex TypeScript, Flow)

**What are Typing Systems for JavaScript?**

Typing systems like TypeScript and Flow add static type checking to JavaScript. They allow developers to define types for variables, functions, and objects, helping catch errors during development rather than at runtime.

**How are typing systems used?**

Typing systems are used to add type annotations to JavaScript code. For example, TypeScript provides a superset of JavaScript that includes static types and type-checking. Flow is another tool that adds type annotations and checks code for type errors.

**Why use typing systems?**

Typing systems improve code quality and maintainability by catching type-related errors early in the development process. They help developers understand how different parts of the code interact and reduce bugs caused by type mismatches, making code more reliable and easier to refactor.

## AJ 1.5 Funktionell programmering i JavaScript

**What is Functional Programming in JavaScript?**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats functions as first-class citizens and emphasizes immutability and pure functions. In JavaScript, this means using functions to avoid changing state and to produce predictable results.

**How is functional programming used?**

Functional programming in JavaScript involves using functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to handle data. It promotes writing code that avoids side effects and changes to data. Functional programming principles help in creating modular and reusable code.

**Why use functional programming?**

Functional programming helps in writing clean, maintainable code by emphasizing immutability and avoiding side effects. It can make code easier to reason about and test, as functions depend only on their inputs and produce predictable outputs.

## AJ 1.6 Avancerad funktionalitet i ES.next

**What is Advanced Functionality in ES.next?**

Advanced functionality in ES.next (ECMAScript next) refers to features introduced in recent versions of JavaScript that go beyond the standard features. This includes new syntax, data structures, and APIs that enhance the language.

**How is advanced functionality used?**

ES.next features include async/await for handling asynchronous operations, classes for object-oriented programming, and new data structures like `Set` and `Map`. These features are used to write more expressive and efficient JavaScript code.

**Why use advanced functionality?**

Using advanced features of ES.next improves code readability, maintainability, and efficiency. They help in writing modern JavaScript that aligns with current best practices and provides more powerful tools for developers.

## AJ 1.7 JavaScript i integrerade system

**What is JavaScript in Integrated Systems?**

JavaScript in integrated systems refers to using JavaScript within systems that combine multiple technologies or platforms. This can include embedding JavaScript in desktop applications, embedded systems, or other environments beyond the web browser.

**How is JavaScript used in integrated systems?**

JavaScript can be used in integrated systems through technologies like Node.js for server-side scripting, Electron for desktop applications, or embedded JavaScript engines in IoT devices. It allows developers to create applications that interact with hardware or other software components.

**Why use JavaScript in integrated systems?**

Using JavaScript in integrated systems offers flexibility and a unified development experience. It allows developers to use the same language for both client-side and server-side development, making it easier to manage and integrate different parts of a system.

## AJ 1.8 Native bundeling av JavaScript för olika operativsystem och enheter

**What is Native Bundling of JavaScript for Different Operating Systems and Devices?**

Native bundling involves packaging JavaScript code to run on different operating systems and devices as native applications. This means converting web applications into standalone apps that can run on various platforms like Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

**How is native bundling done?**

Native bundling is done using tools like Electron or NW.js for desktop applications, and React Native for mobile apps. These tools bundle JavaScript code with a native runtime, allowing web technologies to be used for building cross-platform applications.

**Why use native bundling?**

Native bundling allows developers to leverage their web development skills to build applications for different platforms. It provides a way to create cross-platform apps with a single codebase, reducing development time and effort while reaching a broader audience.
