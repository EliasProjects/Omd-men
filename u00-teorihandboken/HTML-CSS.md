## HC 1.1 HTML & CSS

**What are HTML and CSS?**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It provides the structure of a webpage, using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout HTML elements. It controls the look and feel of the webpage, including colors, fonts, and layout.

**How are HTML and CSS used?**

HTML creates the basic content and structure of a webpage, while CSS is used to style this content. HTML elements are placed within tags, and CSS rules are applied to these tags to enhance their appearance. For example, HTML might define a `<div>` element, and CSS would style it with properties like `background-color` and `padding`.

**Why use HTML and CSS?**

HTML and CSS are fundamental technologies for web development. HTML provides the essential building blocks for web pages, and CSS enables designers to create visually appealing and well-organized sites. Together, they ensure that web pages are both functional and attractive.

## HC 1.2 Responsiv design

**What is Responsive Design?**

Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures webpages look good and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes, from desktop monitors to mobile phones. It involves using flexible layouts, grids, and media queries to adapt the design to different screen resolutions.

**How is responsive design implemented?**

Responsive design is implemented using CSS techniques such as fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. Media queries allow CSS rules to be applied based on the device's screen size, orientation, or resolution. For example, you can use a media query to change the layout of a webpage for smartphones versus desktop computers.

**Why use responsive design?**

Responsive design is crucial for providing a consistent user experience across different devices. It helps ensure that users can easily navigate and interact with a website whether they are on a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop computer. This approach improves accessibility and can positively impact search engine rankings.

## HC 1.3 Tillgänglighet inom webb

**What is Web Accessibility?**

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes ensuring that content is accessible to screen readers, providing keyboard navigation, and using high-contrast colors.

**How is web accessibility achieved?**

Web accessibility is achieved through practices such as using semantic HTML elements, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring that forms are accessible via keyboard and screen readers. Following guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) helps ensure that websites are usable by everyone.

**Why is web accessibility important?**

Web accessibility is important because it ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can access and interact with web content. It promotes inclusivity and equal access to information, services, and online experiences. Moreover, adhering to accessibility standards can help avoid legal issues and enhance the overall user experience.

## HC 1.4 Aktuella webbstandarder (gällande och kommande standarder)

**What are Web Standards?**

Web standards are guidelines and specifications developed by organizations like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that web technologies are used consistently and interoperably. These standards include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript specifications, as well as best practices for web development.

**How are web standards applied?**

Web standards are applied by following the specifications set forth by relevant organizations. For example, developers use HTML5 and CSS3 specifications to create modern web pages. Keeping up-to-date with current standards and implementing them ensures that websites are compatible across different browsers and devices.

**Why are web standards important?**

Web standards are important because they promote consistency and compatibility across different web browsers and devices. They help ensure that web content is accessible, functional, and performs well. Adhering to standards also aids in future-proofing websites, as newer technologies build on existing standards.

## HC 1.5 CSS Pre-processorer (ex SASS/LESS)

**What are CSS Pre-processors?**

CSS pre-processors like SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) and LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) extend the capabilities of CSS by adding features such as variables, nesting, and mixins. These tools help streamline and organize CSS code, making it more maintainable and efficient.

**How are CSS pre-processors used?**

CSS pre-processors are used by writing stylesheets in the pre-processor’s syntax and then compiling them into standard CSS files. Features like variables allow you to store values (e.g., colors, fonts) and reuse them throughout your stylesheets. Nesting lets you organize styles in a hierarchical manner.

**Why use CSS pre-processors?**

CSS pre-processors improve the maintainability and scalability of stylesheets. They allow for more efficient code management, easier updates, and better organization of styles. By using features like variables and mixins, developers can avoid repetitive code and create more modular and readable CSS.

## HC 1.6 Optimering och validering av HTML & CSS

**What is HTML & CSS Optimization and Validation?**

Optimization refers to improving the performance and efficiency of HTML and CSS code. Validation is the process of checking code against official standards to ensure it is correct and free of errors.

**How are HTML & CSS optimized and validated?**

Optimization can be achieved by minimizing and compressing code, removing unnecessary elements, and using efficient selectors. Validation involves using tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service for HTML and the W3C CSS Validator to check for errors and ensure compliance with standards.

**Why optimize and validate HTML & CSS?**

Optimizing HTML and CSS improves website performance by reducing load times and enhancing the user experience. Validation ensures that code is correct and adheres to standards, which helps prevent errors and compatibility issues across different browsers and devices.
