## PJ 1.1 Agila metoder (Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming)

**What are Agile Methods?**

Agile methods are project management approaches that focus on iterative development, flexibility, and collaboration. They emphasize delivering small, incremental improvements to a project and adapting to changes quickly.

**How are Agile Methods used?**

1. **Scrum**: Scrum divides a project into small, manageable parts called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Teams work on specific tasks during each sprint and hold regular meetings (Daily Standups) to track progress and adjust plans.
2. **Kanban**: Kanban uses a visual board to manage workflow, displaying tasks as they move through different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). It focuses on continuous delivery and limiting work in progress.
3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**: XP emphasizes technical excellence and customer satisfaction through practices like pair programming, continuous integration, and frequent releases. It aims for high-quality code and close collaboration with the client.

**Why use Agile Methods?**

Agile methods improve flexibility and responsiveness to change. They enhance team collaboration and provide regular feedback, allowing for continuous improvement and faster delivery of valuable features.

## PJ 1.2 Icke-agila metoder

**What are Non-Agile Methods?**

Non-agile methods, often referred to as traditional or waterfall methodologies, follow a linear and sequential approach to project management. They typically involve distinct phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.

**How are Non-Agile Methods used?**

1. **Waterfall**: The Waterfall model requires completing each phase before moving to the next. Detailed planning and documentation are done upfront, and changes are difficult to accommodate once the project is underway.
2. **V-Model**: The V-Model extends the Waterfall approach by emphasizing the verification and validation of each phase. Testing is planned and executed alongside development to ensure that requirements are met.

**Why use Non-Agile Methods?**

Non-agile methods provide a structured and predictable approach to project management. They are useful for projects with well-defined requirements and less likelihood of change. They offer clear documentation and a sequential process that can be easier to manage and track.

## PJ 1.3 Entreprenörskap inom webbutveckling

**What is Entrepreneurship in Web Development?**

Entrepreneurship in web development involves creating and managing web-based businesses or startups. It includes identifying market opportunities, developing innovative solutions, and building a sustainable business model.

**How is Entrepreneurship practiced?**

Entrepreneurs in web development often start by identifying a niche or problem that needs solving. They develop a business plan, create a web product or service, and market it to potential customers. Key aspects include product development, user experience design, and business strategy.

**Why focus on Entrepreneurship in Web Development?**

Entrepreneurship drives innovation and offers opportunities to create new products and services. It encourages creativity and problem-solving, and it enables individuals to shape their own careers by building successful web-based ventures.

## PJ 1.4 Issue Distribution and Handling in a Group

**What is Issue Distribution and Handling in a Group?**

Issue distribution and handling involve identifying, assigning, and managing tasks or problems within a team. It ensures that issues are addressed efficiently and that team members have clear responsibilities.

**How is Issue Distribution managed?**

1. **Issue Tracking Tools**: Tools like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Issues are used to track and manage tasks. Issues are logged, prioritized, and assigned to team members.
2. **Task Assignment**: Tasks are distributed based on team members' skills, availability, and workload. Clear communication and regular updates help manage progress and address any blockers.
3. **Resolution Process**: Issues are addressed through defined processes, including investigation, resolution, and follow-up. Teams may hold meetings to discuss and resolve issues collaboratively.

**Why use Issue Distribution and Handling?**

Effective issue distribution and handling ensure that tasks are completed on time and that problems are resolved efficiently. It promotes teamwork, accountability, and transparency, leading to better project outcomes and smoother workflow management.
